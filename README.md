# WholeBraincFosAnalysis
Automated visual/statistical summary of whole brain cFos data

1. density_plots.pdf is the first output file from the code in this folder. It contains plots summarizing cFos density for all brain regions, sorted by experimental condition
2. stats.pdf is the second output file from the code in this folder. It contains p values for cFos density differences between conditions for all brain regions, organized from most statistically significant to least
3. code to generate these output files is cFosScreen.ipynb. It is not the code for in-depth analysis, but a subsequent one will be added after a full clearing study is complete
