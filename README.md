# WholeBraincFosAnalysis
Automated visual/statistical summary of whole brain cFos data

1. code to generate these output files is cFosScreen.ipynb. It is not the code for in-depth analysis, but a subsequent one will be added after a full clearing study is complete
2. density_plots.pdf is the first output file from the code in this folder. It contains plots summarizing cFos density for all brain regions(with individual plots for left hemisphere, right hemisphere, and total brain results), sorted by experimental condition within plots
3. other pdf files are outputs containing p values for cFos density differences between conditions for all brain regions (with individual columns for left hemisphere, right hemisphere and total brain results), organized from most statistically significant to least -- where users can determine if they would like to organize file by statistical significance in the left hemisphere, right hemisphere or total brain
